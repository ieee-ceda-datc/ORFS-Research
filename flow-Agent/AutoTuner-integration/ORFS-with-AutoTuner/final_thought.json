    "final_summary": "## Analysis Summary for Minimizing Wirelength (ibex-asap7)\n\n**Key Insights from 437 valid runs:**\n\n**Critical Finding:** Hierarchical synthesis (HIER_SYNTH=1) is absolutely essential for good wirelength results. All flattened designs (HIER_SYNTH=0) had wirelength >105K, while the best hierarchical designs achieved 86,883 (global minimum).\n\n**Optimal Parameter Patterns:**\n1. **HIER_SYNTH=1** (hierarchical): Mandatory for competitive results\n2. **High UTIL** (48-69%): Strong negative correlation (-0.71) with wirelength; higher density improves WL\n3. **Relaxed CLK** (7000-10000 ps): Much longer than baseline 1260 ps reduces routing pressure\n4. **High LB_ADDON** (0.7-0.8+): Best results used 4x higher than baseline 0.2\n5. **DPO enabled**: Most good configurations had DPO=1\n6. **Moderate TNS effort** (~48%): Lower than baseline 100% reduces buffer insertion\n7. **Reduced routing adjustments**: PIN_ADJ ~0.33, UP_ADJ ~0.32 (vs baseline 0.5)\n\n**Best Configuration Characteristics (WL=86,883):**\nCLK: 7888 ps, UTIL: 48%, LB_ADDON: 0.80, HIER_SYNTH: 1, DPO: 1, TNS_End_Percent: 48%, PIN_ADJ: 0.333, UP_ADJ: 0.316\n\n**Baseline Comparison:** The ibex-asap7 baseline (CLK: 1260, UTIL: 40, LB_ADDON: 0.2, HIER_SYNTH: 0) represents a suboptimal approach for wirelength. Key improvements: switch to hierarchical synthesis, increase utilization and clock period, boost density margins.\n\n**Final Suggestions:** Five diverse hyperparameter configurations have been generated using Bayesian optimization trained on the most promising subset of data (hierarchical designs with good WL performance). These configurations explore different trade-offs within the identified optimal parameter space and have been saved to final_params.json."
